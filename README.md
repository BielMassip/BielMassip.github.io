It is intended for companies looking for workers. 

My architecture is divided into three noteworthy parts: The header, the "left box" and the "right box". In the header there is all the identification and the profile photo that in this case I have put that of the UDG. In the right and left "boxes" I put all the other information.

Visually, it looks as I explained in the architecture. There is a header with all the identification and afterwards there is all the rest of the information divided into two parts to make it more beautiful. In the identification I have put some icons that I saw and I liked the way they looked. In the skills and languages I also saw CVs that contained percentage bars and I really liked the idea, so I was looking on the internet how they were made and I put them.
